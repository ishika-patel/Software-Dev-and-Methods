    <h1>Patel, Ishika</h1>
    <p> I am inspired by the power in learning languages. As a Comupter Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder, I am developing a greater appreciation of coding languages and their ability to connect the world. This unique ability motivates my drive to study Computer Science. When I am not coding, I love improving my Spanish language skills through listening to music. An interesing fact is that I am able to speak 4 languages. Another is that my family is from India; my cultural backgorund has layed a phenomenla foundation to my curiosity when it comes to communicating. A third interesting fact is that I am left handed!</p>
